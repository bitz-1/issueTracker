### Explanation of the structure:

- `assets`: This directory contains the application's static assets such as CSS files.

  - `css`: The CSS directory stores individual CSS files for different parts of the application.

- `config`: This directory holds configuration files for the application.

  - `dbconfig.js`: The database configuration file, which should be set up with your database credentials.

- `controllers`: This directory contains the controller files responsible for handling the application's logic.

  - `home_controller.js`: The controller responsible for handling actions related to the home page.

- `routes`: The routes directory contains route files that define the endpoints for various functionalities.

  - `index.js`: The main route file that connects the routes to the appropriate controllers.

- `views`: The views directory stores the EJS templates for rendering the web pages.

  - `_footer.ejs`: The partial template for the footer section of the website.
  - `_header.ejs`: The partial template for the header section of the website.
  - `homepage.ejs`: The template for the homepage of the Issue Tracker application.
  - `layout.ejs`: The main layout template that includes the header and footer templates.
  - `listproject.ejs`: The template for displaying a list of projects.
  - `riseissue.ejs`: The template for raising a new issue in a project.
  - `searchproject.ejs`: The template for searching for a project.

- `.env`: The environment file that contains sensitive configuration data such as database credentials or API keys. Ensure not to share this file publicly.

- `index.js`: The main application file, where the server setup and configuration take place. It imports the necessary modules, sets up middleware, connects to the database using `dbconfig.js`, and registers the routes from the `routes` directory.
